# Artikel Swiper
Artikel Swiper is an application for learning German articles by swiping nouns according to the articles that should go with them. There are 2000 nouns that are randomly displayed to a user. If swiped correctly, the next noun is shown.


## Deployment
Following [this guide](https://gist.github.com/cobyism/4730490), the app is deployed on GitHub Pages.


## Attribution
Inspired by [DerDasDie. German articles](https://apps.apple.com/de/app/derdasdie-german-articles/id6480586707).

The [swipeable card stack implementation](https://css-tricks.com/swipeable-card-stack-using-vue-js-and-interact-js/) was used as a base for the application.

2000 German Nouns are taken from [this list](https://frequencylists.blogspot.com/2015/12/the-2000-most-frequent-german-nouns.html).


## Future work
- To be added: [10000 nouns](https://github.com/digitapex/DerDieDas/blob/master/app/src/main/res/raw/list_nouns.txt) - merge with the existing 2000.
- ~Tips for using articles in certain cases.~
- Implement logic for repeating those words which were not guessed correctly at first.
- Keyboard usage on desktop.
- Different vocabulary for different levels: A1 - C2.
- Implement Settings.
- Add audio for better memorization.
